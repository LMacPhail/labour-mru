# New Labour MP Database

This is an interface for researching the new Labour MPs in next year's election. For more information on the project, please contact mps@mvmtresearch.org

## Setup

This is a React app with TypeScript. To get started, run `yarn install` and `yarn start` - the frontend app should then be running at `localhost:3000`.

To get the server running, go into the folder `./server` and run `node server.js`;

## Testing

Run tests with `yarn test`. All tests must pass before your changes can be added to the project.
